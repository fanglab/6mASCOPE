Python SortedContainers

`SortedContainers`_ is an Apache2 licensed `sorted collections library`_,
written in pure-Python, and fast as C-extensions.

Python's standard library is great until you need a sorted collections
type. Many will attest that you can get really far without one, but the moment
you **really need** a sorted list, dict, or set, you're faced with a dozen
different implementations, most using C-extensions without great documentation
and benchmarking.

In Python, we can do better. And we can do it in pure-Python!

.. code-block:: python

    >>> sl = sortedcontainers.SortedList(xrange(10000000))
    >>> 1234567 in sl
    True
    >>> sl[7654321]
    7654321
    >>> sl.add(1234567)
    >>> sl.count(1234567)
    2
    >>> sl *= 3
    >>> len(sl)
    30000003

**Note:** don't try this without at least a half gigabyte of memory. In Python
an integer requires about 24 bytes. SortedList will add about 8 bytes per
object stored in the container. That's pretty hard to beat as it's the cost of
a pointer to each object. It's also 66% less overhead than a typical binary
tree implementation (e.g. red-black tree, avl tree, aa tree, splay tree, treap,
etc.) for which every node must also store two pointers to children nodes.

`SortedContainers`_ takes all of the work out of Python sorted collections -
making your deployment and use of Python easy. There's no need to install a C
compiler or pre-build and distribute custom extensions. Performance is a
feature and testing has 100% coverage with unit tests and hours of stress.

Testimonials
------------

**Alex Martelli**, `Wikipedia`_

Good stuff! ... I like the `simple, effective implementation`_ idea of splitting
the sorted containers into smaller "fragments" to avoid the O(N) insertion costs.

**Jeff Knupp**, `Review of SortedContainers`_

That last part, "fast as C-extensions," was difficult to believe. I would need
some sort of `Performance Comparison`_ to be convinced this is true. The author
includes this in the docs. It is.

**Kevin Samuel**, `Formations Python`_

I'm quite amazed, not just by the code quality (it's incredibly
readable and has more comment than code, wow), but the actual
amount of work you put at stuff that is *not* code:
documentation, benchmarking, implementation explanations. Even
the git log is clean and the unit tests run out of the box on
Python 2 and 3.

**Mark Summerfield**, a short plea for `Python Sorted Collections`_

Python's "batteries included" standard library seems to have a battery
missing. And the argument that "we never had it before" has worn thin. It is
time that Python offered a full range of collection classes out of the box,
including sorted ones.

- Fully documented
- Benchmark comparison (alternatives, runtimes, load-factors)
- 100% test coverage
- Hours of stress testing
- Performance matters (often faster than C implementations)
- Compatible API (nearly identical to popular blist and rbtree modules)

- Pragmatic design (e.g. SortedSet is a Python set with a SortedList index)
- Developed on Python 2.7
- Tested on CPython 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy, PyPy3

Quickstart
----------

Installing `SortedContainers`_ is simple with
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install sortedcontainers

You can access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in help
function:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sortedcontainers import SortedList, SortedSet, SortedDict
    >>> help(SortedList)
